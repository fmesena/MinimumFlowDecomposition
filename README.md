# MinimumFlowDecomposition

**Version 1.0 - 18/09/2022**

## Information about this repository

This repository contains a python script to generate the encoding using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) proposed by Fernando H. C. Dias, Lucia Williams, Brendan Mumey, and Alexandru I. Tomescu, to solve the Minimum Flow Decomposition problem. The paper is the following: "Fast, Flexible, and Exact Minimum Flow Decompositions via ILP" [(see the paper here)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/978-3-031-04749-7_14).

I also used this paper as an excuse to play around the Integer Optimization package of [Google OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization).

## Dependencies
Make sure you have installed the OR-tools package. You can use pip to install it: `pip install ortools`.

To run the program, use the command `python3 MFD.py`.
